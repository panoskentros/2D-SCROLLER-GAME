# Python 2D GUI scroller Game

## This project idea was inspired by TechWithTim on youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6xMBig-pP4&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lp3jAExUCewBfMx3UZFkh5&ab_channel=TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyblLBlpf0s&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lp3jAExUCewBfMx3UZFkh5&index=10)

## Assets used in this project were also created by TechWithTim and were imported from his GitHub https://github.com/techwithtim/pygame-tutorials/tree/master/Game

## The code of the project was completely rewritten and modified by myself. The level editor was also created by me from scratch.
